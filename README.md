Hi everyone welcome to my repo.
In this repo I am gonna make a simple app that can share links to the clients using Sockets.io and the Kivy Documentation in python.

There will be a main server hosting then there wil be a client server getting all the links and messages.
This would be very good if you have a team and want to communicate with them at the same time.

Never Ever use this with a public network or there are chances for you to get hack.
